            The debate between Apple and Samsung is a huge rivalry in the field
            of technology where each brand has some advantages. Apple is
            extremely well recognized for its high-end designs. In contrast,
            Samsung provides innovative designs, such as foldable phones, and a
            lot of options at different prices for all budgets. Samsung devices
            run on an Android base which means more customization and
            flexibility for those users who like changing things up with their
            technology. At the end of the day, Apple and Samsung are chosen
            based on personal preference and individual needs: the sleek
            experience that comes with Apple's ecosystem or the versatility and
            innovation in the products that come out of Samsung.
